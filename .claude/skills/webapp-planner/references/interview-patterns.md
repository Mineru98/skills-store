# Interview Patterns

Patterns for extracting clear requirements from vague customer input.

## Core Principles

1. **Never assume** - Always ask
2. **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm
3. **Repeat back** - Confirm understanding
4. **Dig deeper** - "Why?" is your friend
5. **Stay patient** - Vague answers need more questions

## Opening Questions

Start broad, then narrow down:

```
"What problem are you trying to solve?"
"Who will use this?"
"What does success look like?"
"What's the most important thing this should do?"
```

## Follow-up Patterns

### When answer is vague:

```
Customer: "I want it to be easy to use"
→ "What would make it feel easy? Can you describe a specific action?"

Customer: "Something like [competitor]"
→ "What do you like about [competitor]? What would you change?"

Customer: "It should just work"
→ "Walk me through what 'working' looks like step by step"
```

### When customer doesn't know:

```
Customer: "I'm not sure"
→ "Let me suggest some options: A, B, or C. Which feels closest?"

Customer: "Whatever you think is best"
→ "I want to make sure it fits your needs. Let's explore: [specific question]"
```

### When scope is unclear:

```
"If you could only have ONE feature, what would it be?"
"What's the minimum this needs to do to be useful?"
"What would make this a failure?"
```

## Question Categories

### Problem Space
- What problem are you solving?
- How do you solve it today?
- What's frustrating about the current solution?
- How often does this problem occur?

### Users
- Who will use this?
- How technical are they?
- What devices will they use?
- How many users do you expect?

### Features
- What must it absolutely do?
- What would be nice to have?
- What should it NOT do?
- Any features you've seen elsewhere that you like?

### Constraints
- Any deadlines?
- Budget limitations?
- Technical restrictions?
- Compliance/legal requirements?

### Success Criteria
- How will you know this is successful?
- What metrics matter?
- What's the ideal outcome?

## Confirmation Pattern

After gathering information:

```
"Let me make sure I understand correctly:

**Problem**: You need [X] because [Y]
**Users**: [Who] will use this on [devices]
**Must Have**: [Feature 1], [Feature 2]
**Nice to Have**: [Feature 3]
**Constraints**: [Limitations]

Did I get that right? Anything I missed?"
```

## Red Flags

Watch for these and dig deeper:

- "It should be simple" → Ask what "simple" means
- "Just like [X]" → Ask which parts specifically
- "Everything" → Force prioritization
- "Anyone" → Identify primary user
- "Whenever" → Get specific timeline

## Question Limits

- Max 3 questions per message
- Wait for answers before next round
- Summarize every 5-6 exchanges
- End interview when requirements are clear
